# Travel-prediction
we are bluilding the prediction model for the travel company who wants to plan there marketing budget for next year 
#Dreamworld tours Pune is a company wants to enable and establish a viable business model to expand the customer base. 
#One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages. Currently, there are 5 types 
#of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, King. Looking at the data of the last year,
#we observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, the marketing cost was quite high because customers
#were contacted at random without looking at the available information. The company is now planning to launch a new pacakge 
#i.e. honeymoon tours for couples. but this company wants to target its potential coustomers who are gonna buy honeymoon packages
#and and keeping marketing costs low and targeting  potential customers which will go on a honeymoon trip.
#We need to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and also 
#build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel package.
#task we have to solve:

1) To predict which customer is more likely to purchase the newly introduced travel package
2) Which variables are most significant.
3) Which segment of customers should be targeted more.
